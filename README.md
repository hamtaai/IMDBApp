# IMDBApp

Project for personal use only. The goal is to create an application that:

- Provides an admin UI for adding tv shows
   - This includes imdb ID, current season and episode I'm at, actual season and episode, next episode airing date, etc.
- Automatically updates information about them (e.g current season, next episode air date, etc.)
- Provides an overview of added shows

Note, that the project scope "something that I can use on my localhost with sqlite as database". This is not meant to scale, have proper user handling, etc.
